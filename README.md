# Pentester-in-Training | CPTS Bound

Aspiring cybersecurity professional working on building scripts, projects, and documenting my journey through HTB walkthroughs.

## Expect to see:
- Bash & Python scripts
- Offensive security tools and projects
- HTB retired machine walkthroughs
- My path to obtaining the CPTS certification

### My first project: MAC Address Changer
A tool designed to enhance privacy on public networks when paired with a VPN like Mullvad. This tool reduces digital fingerprinting and tracking, offering an additional layer of anonymity when moving between networks.
